    This thread class contains an instance to an AlarmItem and when it is
    running checks the time every 5 seconds to determine if the Alarm (or any
    pre or post alert) should be triggered.

    This class does NOT edit the variables from the AlarmItem instance reference
    that it takes as constructor parameter. It does attach a callback function
    reference for the alert trigger in this thread, and it only uses the class
    instance data to determine if the alarm is meant to be trigger or not.

    If it reads old data while it is being modified by AlarmManger, it will read
    the new correct version at the next infinite loop iteration and not cause a
    problem.

    It is for this reason that locks are not required for the AlarmItem data or
    the __run private variable (modifiable by the externally accessible stop()
    method).
